            &emsp; Before we begin to tell the tale of the fight with Dues, we need to gain an understanding of multiple timelines at play and the key players in each.
        </p>
        <h3>Sword of Justice</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp; The Sword of Justice timeline is characterized by the Chromosome forces manifesting to the forces of injustice. However, these forces of injustice did not 
            go uncontested. One vigilante known as "Justice-Guy" sought to fight off the manifest injustices he saw. Although his power was strong, he faced powerful enemies 
            such as Hitler-Sama and his sister "Fedora-Gal" who was worried he was gonna get hurt out there.
        </p>
        <h3>Sword of Vengeance</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp; While the Sword of Justice timeline was plagued in select areas by the Chromosome forces becoming agents of injustice, in the Sword of Vengeance the influence of 
            the Chromosome was much more diffuse and widely felt by all. This can be seen in the shift in our key player's motivations shift from that of altruistic Justice, to 
            personal Vengeance. Take for instance Niko and Magic Rat's quest to avenge the destruction of their planet by Rancore forces or Chef's journey to write the wrong of her 
            sister's death or even the Sheriff's blind attack on all living creators for his involuntary involvement in an unjust war.  
        </p>
        <h3>Sword of Suffering</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp; In this timeline the Chromosome forces had all but completely taken over, leaving no means of fighting back the overwhelming suffering. Even an innocent gay commune was no spared,
            instead it was invaded by the forces of Joseph Stalin with only "Suffering-guy" being able to make a meek attempt at resistance by wielding the forces of suffering against itself.
