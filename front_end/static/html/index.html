        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>
            &emsp; We are the Chinscooper Archive. What does that mean you may ask? We are a group dedicated to obtaining and compiling information pertaining to the era known as the "Chromosome Capers"
            in which our world line was threatened by the intangible force of Chromosomes spread throughout the world line. Our world line became inflicted with war, disease and ecological collapse.
            This was until a unit of entities were brought together to fight off the Chromosome God, Dues Ex Machinia. This collection of entities would come to be known as the <b>Chinscooperz</b>.

        <h2>What is this site?</h2>
        <p>
            &emsp; This site is dedicated to uncovering and synthesizing archival footage of the Chinscooperz fight with Dues. Unfortunately, much of the footage from this climatic deul has been lost to time.
            However, in order to fill in the holes in the footage, we have supplemented them with recreations of events, simulations of battles and interviews with the Chinscooperz.
