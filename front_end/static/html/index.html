            <p>
                We are the Godfeet, deities that have observed the activities of several world lines for thousands of years.
                We have been dedicated to obtaining and compiling information pertaining to the era known as the "Chromosome Capers"
                in which our world line was threatened by the intangible force of Chromosomes spread throughout the world line. Our world line became inflicted with war, disease and ecological collapse.
                This was until a unit of entities were brought together to fight off one of the Chromosome Gods: Dues Ex Machinia. This collection of entities would come to be known as the <b>Chinscooperz</b>.

            <p>
                This site is dedicated to uncovering and synthesizing archival footage of the Chinscooperz fight with Dues. Unfortunately, much of the footage from this climatic deul has been lost to time.
                However, in order to fill in the gaps in the footage, we have supplemented them with recreations of events and simulations of battles.
